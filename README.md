## üéØ What‚Äôs Inside?

This repository contains Python scripts and modules for controlling robots and simulating their movements. The code is designed to be used with:

- **RoboDK**: A powerful offline programming and simulation tool for industrial robots.
- **PyBullet**: An open-source physics engine for robotics simulations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Forward Kinematics Models**: Calculate the position and orientation of your robot‚Äôs end-effector.
- **Simulation Integration**: Ready-to-use scripts for integration with RoboDK and PyBullet.
- **Easy-to-Use API**: Simple functions and classes to get you started with minimal hassle.
- **Customizable**: Tweak and extend the models to suit your specific needs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your robot dancing and prancing in no time!

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotics-control-code.git
   cd robotics-control-code
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required Python packages. You can install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will set up everything you need to run the simulations and models.

3. **Run a Sample Simulation**:
   Choose your favorite simulation tool and run one of the sample scripts.
   - **For RoboDK**: Follow the RoboDK integration instructions in `robo_dk_integration.md`.
   - **For PyBullet**: Run `python pybullet_simulation.py` to see your robot in action.

4. **Explore the Code**:
   - **`forward_kinematics.py`**: Contains functions for computing forward kinematics.
   - **`robo_dk_integration.py`**: Scripts and examples for integrating with RoboDK.
   - **`pybullet_simulation.py`**: Example scripts for running simulations in PyBullet.
   - **`utils.py`**: Helper functions and utilities to simplify your development process.

## üîß Customizing Your Robot

Want to modify the code to suit your robot‚Äôs specifications? Here's how:

1. **Edit Robot Parameters**:
   Modify the robot parameters in `robot_parameters.py` to match your robot‚Äôs configuration.

2. **Adjust Kinematic Chains**:
   Update the kinematic chain configurations in `forward_kinematics.py` to reflect your robot‚Äôs joint structure.

3. **Tweak Simulation Settings**:
   For PyBullet, adjust the simulation settings in `pybullet_simulation.py` to match your desired environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are a few tips:

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required Python packages are installed. Check `requirements.txt` for the list.
- **Integration Issues**: Double-check integration steps for RoboDK or PyBullet to ensure proper setup.
- **Debugging**: Use print statements or logging to troubleshoot issues with kinematic calculations.
